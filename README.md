# Countdown Timer
A simple JavaScript countdown timer for websites

# Description
This is a simple JavaScript countdown timer that displays the days, hours, minutes and seconds. Although not overly generic but takes away the overkill on most countdown I've come by.

# Requirements
It will work on any browser that supports JavaScript

# Installation
Download the JS file and link to it on your page like you would normally do a JavaScript file.

#Usage
- in variable 'tthen' the timestamp of a certain date in milliseconds is contained in the variable, change it to the timestamp of the date you want to countdown to.
- The element ids showing the countdown timer are default to "days", "hours", "mins", and "secs", you can decide to use this or change it to your desired one. Basically, just id the elements in your HTML file as the above or your desired ones.
